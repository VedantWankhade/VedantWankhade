Hi ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my work"space"!

<img align="right" src="./attachments/gopher-1.png" width="200" />

I am a Software Engineer with a solid background in Computer Science and hands-on experience building reliable and efficient software.
I currently work on backend systems at my job and specialize in the same, though in my free time, I like to dabble into everything from systems programming to the frontend.

Lately I have started enjoying network programming a lot thanks to Golang.

I value knowing my tools inside out and tend to use software that allow me to do so. I am also a huge advocate for open-source and self hosting (ironic I know, you are reading this on GitHub, but I am working on building my own git server).

## My Goals - One day I hope to
- [ ] Write a window manager
- [ ] Build my own linux distro

- [ ] Finish LFS
- [ ] Write a compiler / interpreter
- [ ] Write an LSP implementation
- [ ] Contribute to the Linux Kernel
- [ ] Build a proper home lab and self host everything
- [ ] ~~Visit Moon~~
