Hi ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my work"space"!

<img align="right" src="./attachments/gopher-1.png" width="200" />

I am a Software Engineer with a solid background in Computer Science and hands-on experience building reliable and efficient software.
I currently work on backend systems at my job and specialize in the same, though in my free time, I like to dabble into everything from systems programming to the frontend.

Lately I have started enjoying network programming a lot thanks to Golang.

I value knowing my tools inside out and tend to use software that allow me to do so. I am also a huge self-hosting and home labbing enthusiast.
